# 3D Soft engine written in zig

This is a first attempt by a person with no experience in
creating a 3D engine. So take everything you see with a
huge grain of salt. But if you have suggests feel free to
raise an issure or contact me.

The engine is based on David Rousset's [tutorial](https://www.davrous.com/2013/06/13/tutorial-series-learning-how-to-write-a-3d-soft-engine-from-scratch-in-c-typescript-or-javascript/) as
well as Andrew Kelly's [tetris](https://github.com/andrewrk/tetris) game implemented
in [zig](https://ziglang.org/) using [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/).

## Dependencies

* [zig](https://ziglang.org/)
* [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/)

## Build
